## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a research scientist with experience in qualitative and quantitative methodologies and tools. In the last years of my career I started to implement programming and data science in my daily activities to expand my skills and knowledge. I have training as a fullstack developer and as a data scientist with an emphasis on mobile development and machine learning. I would like to participate in a company that gives me the opportunity to implement all these new features and continue to develop my career.
